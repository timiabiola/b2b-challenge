# âœ… Server Fixed - Running Instructions

## ðŸŽ¯ The server IS running! Here's how to access it:

### Quick Test Commands

1. **Test if server is responding (run in a NEW terminal):**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/api/health
```

2. **Open in browser:**
- http://localhost:8081
- http://localhost:8081/api/health (health check)

### What was fixed:
- âœ… Removed conflicting package-lock.json
- âœ… Removed --turbopack flag (was causing issues)
- âœ… Created health check endpoint
- âœ… Verified Node.js is working

### To start the server:

**Option 1 - Standard (RECOMMENDED):**
```bash
cd /Users/timiabiola/EI\ Landing\ Page/enlightened-informatics
npm run dev
```

**Option 2 - Direct with npx:**
```bash
cd /Users/timiabiola/EI\ Landing\ Page/enlightened-informatics
npx next dev --port 8081
```

### If browser shows "can't connect":

1. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Chrome: Cmd+Shift+Delete â†’ Clear browsing data
   - Safari: Develop â†’ Empty Caches

2. **Try incognito/private window:**
   - Chrome: Cmd+Shift+N
   - Safari: Cmd+Shift+N

3. **Try different browser:**
   - Safari instead of Chrome
   - Firefox instead of Safari

4. **Check with curl first:**
```bash
# This should return JSON if server is running
curl http://localhost:8081/api/health
```

5. **Disable browser extensions:**
   - Ad blockers
   - VPNs
   - Privacy extensions

### Server IS running when you see:
```
âœ“ Ready in XXXms
```

### Important Notes:
- The "timeout" message in the terminal is NORMAL - it means the server is running continuously
- Leave the terminal window open while using the site
- Press Ctrl+C to stop the server

### Still having issues?
Try the test server to verify your system works:
```bash
cd /Users/timiabiola/EI\ Landing\ Page/enlightened-informatics
node test-server.js
```
Then visit http://localhost:8081 - if this works, the issue is browser-specific.
