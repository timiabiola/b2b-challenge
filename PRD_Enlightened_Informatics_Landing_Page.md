Listen, I get it. You're drowning in data but starving for insights. 
Your team is burnt out from repetitive tasks. And everyone's talking 
about AI, but nobody's showing you HOW to actually use it in your business.

I'm Timi Abiola, and I've spent years mastering the art of making data 
work FOR businesses, not against them. As an AI & Informatics consultant, 
I've cracked the code on transforming overwhelming information into 
actionable growth strategies.

At Enlightened Informatics, we don't just talk about transformationâ€”
